It allows a very easy way to define texts for documentation and extra parameters for each target. Free software: BSD 3 Clause Documentation: https://osl-incubator.github.io/makim How to use it First you need to place the config file .makim.yaml in the root of your project.

Some examples of how to use it: run the build target: makim build run the clean target: makim clean run the build target with the clean flag: makim build --clean The help menu for the .makim.yaml file would looks like this: $ makim --help usage: MakIm [--help] [--version] [--config-file MAKIM_FILE] [target] MakIm is a tool that helps you to organize and simplify your helper commands. positional arguments: target Specify the target command to be performed.

NOTE: 'default.' prefix is optional. options: --help, -h Show the help menu --version Show the version of the installed MakIm tool. --config-file MAKIM_FILE Specify a custom location for the config file.

Write Documentation makim could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official makim docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/osl-incubator/makim.git/issues . If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :) Get Started! For development, we encourage you to use conda . If you don't know what is that, check these links: In Spanish: https://opensciencelabs.org/blog/como-instalar-y-comenzar-utilizar-conda/ In English: https://cloudsmith.com/blog/what-is-conda/ We recommend you to use mamba-forge, a combination of miniconda + conda-forge + mamba. You can download it from here: conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge Ready to contribute? Here\u2019s how to set up makim for local development. Fork the makim repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/makim.git Create a conda environment and activate it: $ mamba env create --file conda/dev.yaml and $ conda activate makim Install your local project copy into your conda environment: $ poetry install Create a branch for local development:: $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature When you\u2019re done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:: $ makim lint $ makim test Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst. The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8. Tips To run a subset of tests:: $ pytest tests.test_containers_sugar Release This project uses semantic-release in order to cut a new release based on the commit-message. Commit message format semantic-release uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, semantic-release automatically determines the next semantic version number, generates a changelog and publishes the release. By default, semantic-release uses Angular Commit Message Conventions . The commit message format can be changed with the preset or config options_ of the @semantic-release/commit-analyzer and @semantic-release/release-notes-generator plugins. Tools such as commitizen or commitlint can be used to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages. The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when semantic-release runs (using the default configuration): Commit message Release type fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when pressure is applied Fix Release feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option Feature Release perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option Chore BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed Breaking Release source: https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/README.md#commit-message-format As this project uses the squash and merge strategy, ensure to apply the commit message format to the PR's title.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
